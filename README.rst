Author clims that this module functionality has been moved to `Reikna <http://python.org/pypi/reikna>`_.
This is not exatly true. Interface is not the same. 
So here just fft.Plan for python3.

PyFFT is a module containing Apple's FFT implementation ported for PyCuda and PyOpenCL.
Documentation can be found in `doc`, managed by `Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org>`_
(or, in rendered form, on `project's page <http://packages.python.org/pyfft>`_).

Module will work only for PyCuda.
